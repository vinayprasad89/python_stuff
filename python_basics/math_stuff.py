# Will cover some basic math functions

# Most of the basic math operations are obvious. The only thing to remember
# is the exponentiation is marked with **
exp = 2 ** 4  # 2 raised to the power 4
print exp

# Any operation that involves a floating point value, returns a floating point
# result

string_val = '5'
int_val = 5
result = string_val * int_val
print result	# This prints 55555

# Using int() to convert a string to an integer
string_val = '5'
int_val = 5
result = int(string_val) * int_val
print result

# Similarly we can use the float method
print float("24")
print float(1)
